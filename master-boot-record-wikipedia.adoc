= Master boot record

* A master boot record (MBR) is a type of boot sector in the first block of
  partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable
  drives intended for use with IBM PC-compatible systems and beyond.
* The concept of MBRs was publicly introduced in 1983 with PC DOS 2.0.

'''

* The MBR holds the information on how the disc's sectors (A.K.A. "blocks")
  are divided into partitions, each partition notionally containing a file
  system.
* The MBR also contains executable code to function as a loader for the
  installed operating system -- usually by passing control over to the
  loader's second stage, or in conjunction with each partition's volume boot
  record (VBR).
* This MBR code is usually referred to as a boot loader.

'''

* The organization of the partition table in the MBR limits the maximum
  addressable storage space of a partitioned disk to 2 TiB (232 Ã— 512 bytes).
* Approaches to slightly raise this limit utilizing 32-bit arithmetic or
  4096-byte sectors are not officially supported, as they fatally break
  compatibility with existing boot loaders, most MBR-compliant operating
  systems and associated system tools, and may cause serious data corruption
  when used outside of narrowly controlled system environments.
* Therefore, the MBR-based partitioning scheme is in the process of being
  superseded by the GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme in new computers.
* A GPT can coexist with an MBR in order to provide some limited form of
  backward compatibility for older systems.

'''

* MBRs are not present on non-partitioned media such as floppies,
  superfloppies or other storage devices configured to behave as such, nor are
  they necessarily present on drives used in non-PC platforms.
