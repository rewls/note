= Secure Shell

* The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH Protocol) is a cryptographic network protocol
  for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
* Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.

'''

* SSH was designed for Unix-like operating systems as a replacement for Telnet
  and unsecured remote Unix shell protocols, such as the Berkeley Remote Shell
  (rsh) and the related rlogin and rexec protocols, which all use insecure,
  plaintext methods of authentication, like passwords.

'''

* Since mechanisms like Telnet and Remote Shell are designed to access and
  operate remote computers, sending the authentication tokens (e.g. username
  and password) for this access to these computers across a public network in
  an unsecured way poses a great risk of 3rd parties obtaining the password
  and achieving the same level of access to the remote system as the telnet
  user.
* Secure Shell mitigates this risk through the use of encryption mechanisms
  that are intended to hide the contents of the transmission from an observer,
  even if the observer has access to the entire data stream.

'''

* Finnish computer scientist Tatu Yl√∂nen designed SSH in 1995 and provided an
  implementation in the form of two commands, `ssh` and `slogin`, as secure
  replacements for `rsh` and `rlogin`, respectively.
* Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer
  groups, producing several variants of implementation.
* The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as
  SSH-1 and SSH-2.
* The most commonly implemented software stack is OpenSSH, released in 1999 as
  open-source software by the OpenBSD developers.
* Implementations are distributed for all types of operating systems in common
  use, including embedded systems.

'''

* SSH applications are based on a client-server architecture, connecting an
  SSH client instance with an SSH server.
* SSH operates as a layered protocol suite comprising three principal
  hierarchical components: the transport layer provides server authentication,
  confidentiality, and integrity; the user authentication protocol validates
  the user to the server; and the connection protocol multiplexes the
  encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels.

== Definition

* SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and
  allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary.

'''

* SSH may be used in several methodologies.
* In the simplest manner, both ends of a communication channel use
  automatically generated public-private key pairs to encrypt a network
  connection, and then use a password to authenticate the user.

'''

* When the public-private key pair is generated by the user manually, the
  authentication is essentially performed when the key pair is created, and a
  session may then be opened automatically without a password prompt.
* In this scenario, the public key is placed on all computers that must allow
  access to the owner of the matching private key, which the owner keeps
  private.
* While authentication is based on the private key, the key is never
  transferred through the network during authentication.
* SSH only verifies that the same person offering the public key also owns the
  matching private key.

'''

* In all versions of SSH it is important to verify unknown public keys, i.e.
  associate the public keys with identities, before accepting them as valid.
* Accepting an attacker's public key without validation will authorize an
  unauthorized attacker as a valid user.
