* #This standard provides rules for secure coding in the C programming
  language.#
* #The goal of these rules and recommendations is to develop safe, reliable,
  and secure systems, for example by eliminating undefined behaviors that can
  lead to undefined program behaviors and exploitable vulnerabilities.#
* #Conformance to the coding rules defined in this standard are necessary (but
  not sufficient) to ensure the safety, reliability, and security of software
  systems developed in the C programming language.#
* It is also necessary, for example, to have a safe and secure design.
* Safety-critical systems typically have stricter requirements than are
  imposed by this coding standard, for example requiring that all memory be
  statically allocated.
* However, the application of this coding standard will result in high-quality
  systems that are reliable, robust, and resistant to attack.

'''

* Each rule consists of a _title_, a _description_, and _noncompliant code
  examples_ and _compliant solutions_, as well as other information as
  described in link:[How this Coding Standard is Organized].
* The title is a concise, but sometimes imprecise, description of the rule.
* The description specifies the normative requirements of the rule.
* The noncompliant code examples are examples of code that would constitute a
  violation of the rule.
* The accompanying compliant solutions demonstrate equivalent code that does
  not violate the rule or any other rules in this coding standard.

'''

* A well-documented and enforceable coding standard is an essential element of
  coding in the C programming language.
* Coding standards encourage programmers to follow a uniform set of rules
  determined by the requirements of the project and organization rather than
  by the programmers' individual preferences.
* Once established, these standards can be used as a metric to evaluate source
  code (using manual or automated processes).

'''

* #CERT's coding standards are being widely adopted by industry.#
* Cisco Systems, Inc. announced its adoption of the CERT C Secure Coding
  Standard as a baseline programming standard in its product development in
  October 2011 at Cisco's annual SecCon conference.
* Recently, Oracle has integrated all of CERT's secure coding standards into
  its existing secure coding standards.
* This adoption is the most recent step of a long collaboration: CERT and
  Oracle previously worked together in authoring _The CERT Oracle Secure
  Coding Standard for Java_ (Addison-Wesley, 2011).

'''

* This wiki contains ongoing updates of the standard between official
  published releases.
* If you are interested in contributing to the rules, create an account on the
  wiki and then request contributor privileges by sending a request to

'''

* The Secure Coding eNewsletter contains news from the CERT Secure Coding
  Initiative as well as summaries of recent updates to the standard rules.
