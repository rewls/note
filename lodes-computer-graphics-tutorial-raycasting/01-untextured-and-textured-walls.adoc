== Introduction

* #Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D
  map.#
* Back when computers were slower it wasn't possible to run real 3D engines in
  realtime, and raycasting was the first solution.
* Raycasting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for
  every vertical line of the screen.
* The most well known game that used this technique, is of course Wolfenstein
  3D.

'''

* The raycasting engine of Wolfenstein 3D was very limited, allowing it to run
  on a even a 286 computer: all the walls have the same height and are
  orthogonal squares on a 2D grid.

'''

* Things like stairs, jumping or height differences are impossible to make
  with this engine.
* Later games such as Doom and Duke Nukem 3D also used raycasting, but much
  more advanced engines that allowed sloped walls, different heights, textured
  floors and ceilings, transparent walls, etc...
* The sprites (enemies, objects and goodies) are 2D images, but sprites aren't
  discussed in this tutorial for now.

'''

* Ray__casting__ is not the same as ray__tracing__!
* Raycasting is a fast semi-3D technique that works in realtime even on 4MHz
  graphical calculators, while raytracing is a realistic rendering technique
  that supports reflections and shadows in true 3D scenes, and only recently
  computers became fast enough to do it in realtime for reasonably high
  resolutions and complex scenes.

'''

* The code of the untextured and textured raycasters is given in this document
  completely, but it's quite long, you can also download the code instead:
  link:raycaster_flat.cpp[], link:raycaster_textured.cpp[]

== The Basic Idea

* The basic idea of raycasting is as follows: the map is a 2D square grid, and
  each square can either be 0 (= no wall), or a positive value (= a wall with
  a certain color or texture).

'''

* For every x of the screen (i.e. for every vertical stripe of the screen),
  send out a ray that starts at the player location and with a direction that
  depends on both the player's looking direction, and the x-coordinate of the
  screen.
* Then, let this ray move forward on the 2D map, until it hits a map square
  that is a wall.
* If it hit a wall, calculate the distance of this hit point to the player,
  and use this distance to calculate how high this wall has to be drawn on the
  screen: the further away the wall, the smaller it's on screen, and the
  closer, the higher it appears to be.
* These are all 2D calculations.

'''

* To find the first wall that a ray encounters on its way, you have to let it
  start at the player's position, and then all the time, check whether or not
  the ray is inside a wall.
* If it's inside a wall (hit), then the loop can stop, calculate the distance,
  and draw the wall with the correct height.
* If the ray position is not in a wall, you have to trace it further: add a
  certain value to its position, in the direction of the direction of this
  ray, and for this new position, again check if it's inside a wall or not.
* Keep doing this until finally a wall is hit.

'''

* A human can immediately see where the ray hits the wall, but it's impossible
  to find which square the ray hits immediately with a single formula, because
  a computer can only check a finite number of positions on the ray.
* Many raycasters add a constant value to the ray each step, but then there's
  a chance that it may miss a wall!

'''

* As you can see, the ray goes straight through the blue wall, but the
  computer didn't detect this, because it only checked at the positions with
  the red dots.
* The more positions you check, the smaller the chance that the computer won't
  detect a wall, but the more calculations are needed.

'''

* For infinite precision with this method, an infinitely small step size, and
  thus an infinite number of calculations would be needed!
* That's pretty bad, but luckily, there's a better method that requires only
  very few calculations and yet will detect every wall: the idea is to check
  at every side of a wall the ray will encounter.
* We give each square width 1, so each side of a wall is an integer value and
  the places in between have a value after the point.
* Now the step size isn't constant, it depends on the distance to the next
  side:

'''

* As you can see on the image above, the ray hits the wall exactly where we
  want it.
* In the way presented in this tutorial, an algorithm is used that's based on
  DDA or "Digital Differential Analysis".
* DDA is a fast algorithm typically used on square grids to find which squares
  a line hits (for example to draw a line on a screen, which is a grid of
  square pixels).
* So we can also use it to find which squares of the map our ray hits, and
  stop the algorithm once a square that is a wall is hit.

'''

* Some raytracers work with Euclidean angles to represent the direction of the
  player and the rays, and determinate the Field Of View with another angle.
* I found however that it's much easier to work with vectors and a camera
  instead: the position of the player is always a vector (an x and a y
  coordinate), but now, we make the direction a vector as well: so the
  direction is now determined by two values: the x and y coordinate of the
  direction.
* A direction vector can be seen as follows: if you draw a line in the
  direction the player looks, through the position of the player, then every
  point of the line is the sum of the position of the player, and a multiple
  of the direction vector.
* The length of a direction vector doesn't really matter, only its direction.
* Multiplying x and y by the same value changes the length but keeps the same
  direction.

'''

* This method with vectors also requires an extra vector, which is the camera
  plane vector.
* In a true 3D engine, there's also a camera plane, and there this plane is
  really a 3D plane so two vectors (u and v) are required to represent it.
* Raycasting happens in a 2D map however, so here the camera plane isn't
  really a plane, but a line, and is represented with a single vector.
* The camera plane should always be perpendicular on the direction vector.
* The camera plane represents the surface of the computer screen, while the
  direction vector is perpendicular on it and points inside the screen.
* The position of the player, which is a single point, is a point in front of
  the camera plane.
* A certain ray of a certain x-coordinate of the screen, is then the ray that
  starts at this player position, and goes through that position on the screen
  or thus the camera plane.

'''

image::raycastingcamera.gif[]

* The image above represents such a 2D camera.
* The green spot is the position (vector "pos").
* The black line, ending in the black spot, represents the direction vector
  (vector "dir"), so the position of the black dot is pos+dir.
* The blue line represents the full camera plane, the vector from the black
  dot to the right blue dot represents the vector "plane", so the position of
  the right blue point is pos+dir+plane, and the position of the left blue
  dot is pos+dir-plane (these are all vector additions).

'''

* The red lines in the image are a few rays.
* The direction of these rays is easily calculated out of the camera: it's the
  sum of the direction vector of the camera, and a part of the plane vector of
  the camera: for example the third red ray on the image, goes through the
  right part of the camera plane at the point about 1/3th of its length.
* So the direction of this ray is dir + plane * 1 / 3.
* This ray direction is the vector rayDir, and the X and Y component of this
  vector are then used by the DDA algorithm.

'''

* The two outer lines, are the left and right border of the screen, and the
  angle between those two lines is called the Field Of Vision or FOV.
* The FOV is determined by the ratio of the length of the direction vector,
  and the length of the plane.
* Here are a few examples of different FOV's:

'''

* If the direction vector and the camera plane vector have the same length,
  the FOV will be 90°.

'''

* If the direction vector is much longer than the camera plane, the FOV will
  be much smaller than 90°, and you'll have a very narrow vision.
* You'll see everything more detailed though and there will be less depth, so
  this is the same as zooming in.

'''

* If the direction vector is shorter than the camera plane, the FOV will be
  larger than 90° (180° is the maximum, if the direction vector is close to
  0), and you'll have a much wider vision, like zooming out.

'''

* When the player rotates, the camera has to rotate, so both the direction
  vector and the plane vector have to be rotated.
* Then, the rays will all automatically rotate as well.

'''

* To rotate a vector, multiply it with the rotation matrix

....
[ cos(a) -sin(a) ]
[ sin(a)  cos(a) ]
....

* If you don't know about vectors and matrices, try to find a tutorial with
  google, an appendix about those is planned for this tutorial later.

'''

* There's nothing that forbids you to use a camera plane that isn't
  perpendicular to the direction, but the result will look like a "skewed"
  world.

== Untextured Raycaster

* Download the source code here: link:raycaster_flat.cpp[]

'''

* To start with the basics, we'll begin with an untextured raycaster.
* This example also includes an fps counter (frames per second), and input
  keys with collision detection to move and rotate.

'''

* The map of the world is a 2D array, where each value represents a square.
* If the value is 0, that square represents an empty, walkthroughable square,
  and if the value is higher than 0, it represents a wall with a certain
  color or texture.
* The map declared here is very small, only 24 by 24 squares, and is defined
  directly in the code.
* For a real game, like Wolfenstein 3D, you use a bigger map and load it from
  a file instead.
* All the zero's in the grid are empty space, so basically you see a very big
  room, with a wall around it (the values 1), a small room inside it (the
  values 2), a few pillars (the values 3), and a corridor with a room (the
  values 4).
* Note that this code isn't inside any function yet, put it before the main
  function starts.

};
----

* A first few variables are declared: posX and posY represent the position
  vector of the player, dirX and dirY represent the direction of the player,
  and planeX and planeY the camera plane of the player.
* Make sure the camera plane is perpendicular to the direction, but you can
  change the length of it.
* The ratio between the length of the direction and the camera plane
  determines the FOV, here the direction vector is a bit longer than the
  camera plane, so the FOV will be smaller than 90° (more precisely, the FOV
  is 2 * atan(0.66/1.0)=66°, which is perfect for a first person shooter
  game).
* Later on when rotating around with the input keys, the values of dir and
  plane will be changed, but they'll always remain perpendicular and keep the
  same length.

'''

* The variables time and oldTime will be used to store the time of the current
  and the previous frame, the time difference between these two can be used to
  determine how much you should move when a certain key is pressed (to move
  a constant speed no matter how long the calculation of the frames takes),
  and for the FPS counter.

* The rest of the main function starts now.
* First, the screen is created with a resolution of choice.

  uploading a whole screen from the CPU to the video card goes so slow.#

* After setting up the screen, the gameloop starts, this is the loop that
  draws a whole frame and reads the input every time.

  while(!done())
  {
----

* Here starts the actual raycasting.
* The raycasting loop is a for loop that goes through every x, so there isn't
  a calculation for every pixel of the screen, but only for every vertical
  stripe, which isn't much at all!
* To begin the raycasting loop, some variables are declared and calculated:

'''

* The ray starts at the position of the player (posX, posY).

'''

* cameraX is the x-coordinate on the camera plane that the current
  x-coordinate of the screen represents, done this way so that the right side
  of the screen will get coordinate 1, the center of the screen gets
  coordinate 0, and the left side of the screen gets coordinate -1.
* Out of this, the direction of the ray can be calculated as was explained
  earlier: as the sum of the direction vector, and a part of the plane vector.
* This has to be done both for the x and y coordinate of the vector (since
  adding two vectors is adding their x-coordinates, and adding their
  y-coordinates).

[,c++]
----
    for(int x = 0; x < w; x++)
    {
      //calculate ray position and direction
      double cameraX = 2 * x / double(w) - 1; //x-coordinate in camera space
      double rayDirX = dirX + planeX * cameraX;
      double rayDirY = dirY + planeY * cameraX;
----

* In the next code piece, more variables are declared and calculated, these
  have relevance to the DDA algorithm:

'''

* mapX and mapY represent the current square of the map the ray is in.
* The ray position itself is a floating point number and contains both info
  about in which square of the map we are, and where in that square we are,
  but mapX and mapY are only the coordinates of that square.

'''

* sideDistX and sideDistY are initially the distance the ray has to travel
  from its start position to the first x-side and the first y-side.
* Later in the code they will be incremented while steps are taken.

'''

* deltaDistX and deltaDistY are the distance the ray has to travel to go from
  1 x-side to the next x-side, or from 1 y-side to the next y-side.

'''

* When deriving deltaDistX geometrically you get, with Pythagoras, the
  formulas below.
* For the blue triangle (deltaDistX), one side has length 1 (as it is exactly
  one cell) and the other has length raydirY / raydirX because it is exactly
  the amount of units the ray goes in the y-direction when taking 1 step in
  the X-direction.
* For the green triangle (deltaDistY), the formula is similar.

deltaDistX = sqrt(1 + (rayDirY * rayDirY) / (rayDirX * rayDirX))
deltaDistY = sqrt(1 + (rayDirX * rayDirX) / (rayDirY * rayDirY))

* But this can be simplified to:

deltaDistX = abs(|rayDir| / rayDirX)
deltaDistY = abs(|rayDir| / rayDirY)

* Where |rayDir| is the length of the vector rayDirX, rayDirY (that is
  sqrt(rayDirX * rayDirX + rayDirY * rayDirY)): you can indeed verify that
  e.g. sqrt(1 + (rayDirY * rayDirY) / (rayDirX * rayDirX)) equals
  abs(sqrt(rayDirX * rayDirX + rayDirY * rayDirY) / rayDirX).
* However, we can use 1 instead of |rayDir|, because only the *ratio* between
  deltaDistX and deltaDistY matters for the DDA code that follows later below,
  so we get:

deltaDistX = abs(1 / rayDirX)
deltaDistY = abs(1 / rayDirY)

* Due to this, the deltaDist and sideDist values used in the code do not match
  the lengths shown in the picture above, but their relative sizes all still
  match.

[thanks to Artem for spotting this simplification]

* The variable perpWallDist will be used later to calculate the length of the
  ray.

'''

* The DDA algorithm will always jump exactly one square each loop, either a
  square in the x-direction, or a square in the y-direction.
* If it has to go in the negative or positive x-direction, and the negative or
  positive y-direction will depend on the direction of the ray, and this fact
  will be stored in stepX and stepY.
* Those variables are always either -1 or +1.

'''

* Finally, hit is used to determinate whether or not the coming loop may be
  ended, and side will contain if an x-side or a y-side of a wall was hit.
* If an x-side was hit, side is set to 0, if an y-side was hit, side will be 1.
* By x-side and y-side, I mean the lines of the grid that are the borders
  between two squares.

----

[NOTE]
====
* If rayDirX or rayDirY are 0, the division through zero is avoided by setting
  it to a very high value 1e30.
* If you are using a language such as C++, Java or JS, this is not actually
  needed, as it supports the IEEE 754 floating point standard, which gives the
  result Infinity, which works correctly in the code below.
* However, some other languages, such as Python, disallow division through
  zero, so the more generic code that works everywhere is given above.
* 1e30 is an arbitrarily chosen high enough number and can be set to Infinity
  if your programming language supports assigning that value.
====

* Now, before the actual DDA can start, first stepX, stepY, and the initial
  sideDistX and sideDistY still have to be calculated.

'''

* If the ray direction has a negative x-component, stepX is -1, if the ray
  direction has a positive x-component it's +1.
* If the x-component is 0, it doesn't matter what value stepX has since it'll
  then be unused.
* The same goes for the y-component.

'''

* If the ray direction has a negative x-component, sideDistX is the distance
  from the ray starting position to the first side to the left, if the ray
  direction has a positive x-component the first side to the right is used
  instead.
* The same goes for the y-component, but now with the first side above or
  below the position.
* For these values, the integer value mapX is used and the real position
  subtracted from it, and 1.0 is added in some of the cases depending if the
  side to the left or right, of the top or the bottom is used.
* Then you get the perpendicular distance to this side, so multiply it with
  deltaDistX or deltaDistY to get the real Euclidean distance.

      //calculate step and initial sideDist

      {
        stepX = -1;

      }
----

* Now the actual DDA starts.
* It's a loop that increments the ray with 1 square every time, until a wall
  is hit.
* Each time, either it jumps a square in the x-direction (with stepX) or a
  square in the y-direction (with stepY), it always jumps 1 square at once.
* If the ray's direction would be the x-direction, the loop will only have to
  jump a square in the x-direction everytime, because the ray will never
  change its y-direction.
* If the ray is a bit sloped to the y-direction, then every so many jumps in
  the x-direction, the ray will have to jump one square in the y-direction.
* If the ray is exactly the y-direction, it never has to jump in the
  x-direction, etc...

'''

* sideDistX and sideDistY get incremented with deltaDistX with every jump in
  their direction, and mapX and mapY get incremented with stepX and stepY
  respectively.

'''

* When the ray has hit a wall, the loop ends, and then we'll know whether an
  x-side or y-side of a wall was hit in the variable "side", and what wall was
  hit with mapX and mapY.
* We won't know exactly where the wall was hit however, but that's not needed
  in this case because we won't use textured walls for now.

----
      //perform DDA
      while (hit == 0)
      {
        //jump to next map square, either in x-direction, or in y-direction
        if (sideDistX < sideDistY)
        {
          sideDistX += deltaDistX;
          mapX += stepX;
          side = 0;
        }
        else
        {
          sideDistY += deltaDistY;
          mapY += stepY;
          side = 1;
        }
        //Check if ray has hit a wall
        if (worldMap[mapX][mapY] > 0) hit = 1;
      } 
----

* After the DDA is done, we have to calculate the distance of the ray to the
  wall, so that we can calculate how high the wall has to be drawn after this.

'''

* We don't use the Euclidean distance to the point representing player, but
  instead the distance to the camera plane (or, the distance of the point
  projected on the camera direction to the player), to avoid the fisheye
  effect.
* The fisheye effect is an effect you see if you use the real distance, where
  all the walls become rounded, and can make you sick if you rotate.

'''

* Note that this part of the code isn't "fisheye correction", such a
  correction isn't needed for the way of raycasting used here, the fisheye
  effect is simply avoided by the way the distance is calculated here.
* It's even easier to calculate this perpendicular distance than the real
  distance, we don't even need to know the exact location where the wall was
  hit.

'''

* This perpendicular distance is called "perpWallDist" in the code.
* One way to compute it is to use the formula for shortest distance from a
  point to a line, where the point is where the wall was hit, and the line is
  the camera plane:

'''

* However, it can be computed simpler than that: due to how deltaDist and
  sideDist were scaled by a factor of |rayDir| above, the length of sideDist
  already almost equals perpWallDist.
* We just need to subtract deltaDist once from it, going one step back,
  because in the DDA steps above we went one step further to end up inside the
  wall.

'''

* Depending on whether the ray hit an X side or Y side, the formula is
  computed using sideDistX, or sideDistY.

[,c++]
----
      //Calculate distance projected on camera direction (Euclidean distance would give fisheye effect!)
      if(side == 0) perpWallDist = (sideDistX - deltaDistX);
      else          perpWallDist = (sideDistY - deltaDistY);
----

* A more detailed derivation of the perpWallDist formula is depicted in the
  image below, for the side == 1 case.

'''

* Meaning of the points:

'''

* P: position of the player, (posX, posY) in the code
* H: hitpoint of the ray on the wall. +
  Its y-position is known to be mapY + (1 - stepY) / 2
* yDist matches "(mapY + (1 - stepY) / 2 - posY)", this is the y coordinate of
  the Euclidean distance vector, in world coordinates. +
  Here, (1 - stepY) / 2) is a correction term that is 0 or 1 based on positive
  or negative y direction, which is also used in the initialization of
  sideDistY.
* dir: the main player looking direction, given by dirX,dirY in the code. +
  The length of this vector is always exactly 1. +
  This matches the looking direction in the center of the screen, as opposed
  to the direction of the current ray. +
  It is perpendicular to the camera plane, and perpWallDist is parallel to
  this.
* orange dotted line (may be hard to see, use CTRL+scrollwheel or CTRL+plus to
  zoom in a desktop browser to see it better): the value that was added to dir
  to get rayDir. +
  Importantly, this is parallel to the camera plane, perpendicular to dir.
* A: point of the camera plane closest to H, the point where perpWallDist
  intersects with camera plane
* B: point of X-axis through player closest to H, point where yDist crosses
  the world X-axis through the player
* C: point at player position + rayDirX
* D: point at player position + rayDir.
* E: This is point D with the dir vector subtracted, in other words, E + dir =
  D.
* points A, B, C, D, E, H and P are used in the explanation below: they form
  triangles which are considered: BHP, CDP, AHP and DEP.

'''

* The actual derivation:
1. Triangles PBH and PCD have the same shape but different size, so same
   ratios of edges
2. Given step 1, the triangles show that the ratio yDist / rayDirY is equal to
   the ratio Euclidean / |rayDir|, so now we can derive perpWallDist =
   Euclidean / |rayDir| instead.
3. Triangles AHP and EDP have the same shape but different size, so same
   ratios of edges. +
   Length of edge ED, that is |ED|, equals length of dir, |dir|, which is 1. +
   Similarly, |DP| equals |rayDir|.
4. Given step 3, the triangles show that the ratio Euclidean / |rayDir| =
   perpWallDist / |dir| = perpWallDist / 1.
5. Combining steps 4 and 2 shows that perpWallDist = yDist / rayDirY, where
   yDist is mapY + (1 - stepY) / 2) - posY
6. In the code, sideDistY - deltaDistY, after the DDA steps, equals (mapY + (1
   - stepY) / 2 - posY) * deltaDistY (given that sideDistY is computed from
   posY and mapY), so yDist = (sideDistY - deltaDistY) / deltaDistY
7. Given that deltaDistY = 1 / |rayDirY|, step 6 gives that yDist = (sideDistY
   - deltaDistY) * |rayDirY|
8. Combining steps 5 and 7 gives perpWallDist = yDist / rayDirY = (sideDistY -
   deltaDistY) / |rayDirY| / rayDirY.
9. Given how cases for signs of sideDistY and deltaDistY in the code are
   handled the absolute value doesn't matter, and equals (sideDistY -
   deltaDistY), which is the formula used perpWallDist

image::raycastperpwalldist.png[]

'''

* Now that we have the calculated distance (perpWallDist), we can calculate
  the height of the line that has to be drawn on screen: this is the inverse
  of perpWallDist, and then multiplied by h, the height in pixels of the
  screen, to bring it to pixel coordinates.
* You can of course also multiply it with another value, for example 2*h, if
  you want to walls to be higher or lower.
* The value of h will make the walls look like cubes with equal height, width
  and depth, while large values will create higher boxes (depending on your
  monitor).

'''

* Then out of this lineHeight (which is thus the height of the vertical line
  that should be drawn), the start and end position of where we should really
  draw are calculated.
* The center of the wall should be at the center of the screen, and if these
  points lie outside the screen, they're capped to 0 or h-1.

[,c++]
----
      //Calculate height of line to draw on screen
      int lineHeight = (int)(h / perpWallDist);

      if(drawStart < 0)drawStart = 0;
      int drawEnd = lineHeight / 2 + h / 2;
      if(drawEnd >= h)drawEnd = h - 1;
----

* Finally, depending on what number the wall that was hit has, a color is
  chosen.
* If an y-side was hit, the color is made darker, this gives a nicer effect.
* And then the vertical line is drawn with the verLine command.
* This ends the raycasting loop, after it has done this for every x at least.

[,c++]

      //choose wall color
      ColorRGB color;
      switch(worldMap[mapX][mapY])

        case 2:  color = RGB_Green;  break; //green
        case 3:  color = RGB_Blue;   break; //blue
        case 4:  color = RGB_White;  break; //white
        default: color = RGB_Yellow; break; //yellow
      }

      //give x and y sides different brightness
      if (side == 1) {color = color / 2;}

      //draw the pixels of the stripe as a vertical line
      verLine(x, drawStart, drawEnd, color);
    }
----

* After the raycasting loop is done, the time of the current and the previous
  frame are calculated, the FPS (frames per second) is calculated and printed,
  and the screen is redrawn so that everything (all the walls, and the value
  of the fps counter) becomes visible.
* After that the backbuffer is cleared with cls(), so that when we draw the
  walls again the next frame, the floor and ceiling will be black again
  instead of still containing pixels from the previous frame.

'''

* The speed modifiers use frameTime, and a constant value, to determine the
  speed of the moving and rotating of the input keys.
* Thanks to using the frameTime, we can make sure that the moving and rotating
  speed is independent of the processor speed.

'''

* The last part is the input part, the keys are read.

'''

* If the up arrow is pressed, the player will move forward: add dirX to posX,
  and dirY to posY.
* This assumes that dirX and dirY are normalized vectors (their length is 1),
  but they were initially set like this, so it's ok.
* There's also a simple collision detection built in, namely if the new
  position will be inside a wall, you won't move.
* This collision detection can be improved however, for example by checking if
  a circle around the player won't go inside the wall instead of just a single
  point.

'''

* The same is done if you press the down arrow, but then the direction is
  subtracted instead.

'''

* To rotate, if the left or right arrow is pressed, both the direction vector
  and plane vector are rotated by using the formulas of multiplication with
  the rotation matrix (and over the angle rotSpeed).

== Textured Raycaster

* Download the source code here: raycaster_textured.cpp

'''

* The core of the textured version of the raycaster is almost the same, only
  at the end some extra calculations need to be done for the textures, and a
  loop in the y-direction is required to go through every pixel to determinate
  which texel (texture pixel) of the texture should be used for it.

'''

* The vertical stripes can't be drawn with the vertical line command anymore,
  instead every pixel has to be drawn separately.
* The best way is to use a 2D array as screen buffer this time, and copy it to
  the screen at once, that goes a lot faster than using pset.

'''

* Of course we now also need an extra array for the textures, and since the
  "drawbuffer" function works with single integer values for colors (instead
  of 3 separate bytes for R, G and B), the textures are stored in this format
  as well.
* Normally, you'd load the textures from a texture file, but for this simple
  example some dumb textures are generated instead.

'''

* The code is mostly the same as the previous example, the bold parts are new.
  Only new parts are explained.

'''

* The screenWidth and screenHeight are now defined in the beginning because we
  need the same value for the screen function, and to create the screen
  buffer.
* Also new are the texture width and height that are defined here.
* These are obviously the width and height in texels of the textures.

'''

* The world map is changed too, this is a more complex map with corridors and
  rooms to show the different textures.
* Again, the 0's are empty walkthrougable spaces, and each positive number
  corresponds to a different texture.

  of the screen.
* Now we need a loop in the y-direction to give each pixel of the vertical
  stripe the correct y-coordinate of the texture, called texY.

'''

* The value of texY is calculated by increasing by a precomputed step size
  (which is possible because this is constant in the vertical stripe) for each
  pixel.
* The step size tells how much to increase in the texture coordinates (in
  floating point) for every pixel in vertical screen coordinates.
* It then needs to cast the floating point value to integer to select the
  actual texture pixel.

====
* a faster integer-only bresenham or DDA algorithm may be possible for this.

[NOTE]
====
* The stepping being done here is affine texture mapping, which means we can
  interpolate linearly between two points rather than have to compute a
  different division for each pixel.
* This is not perspective correct in general, but for perfectly vertical walls
  (and also perfectly horizontal floors/ceilings) it is, so we can use it for
  raycasting.
====

* The color of the pixel to be drawn is then simply gotten from
  texture[texNum][texX][texY], which is the correct texel of the correct
  texture.

'''

* Like the untextured raycaster, here too we'll make the color value darker if
  an y-side of the wall was hit, because that looks a little bit better (like
  there is a sort of lighting).
* However, because the color value doesn't exist out of a separate R, G and B
  value, but these 3 bytes sticked together in a single integer, a not so
  intuitive calculation is used.

* The color is made darker by dividing R, G and B through 2.
* Dividing a decimal number through 10, can be done by removing the last digit
  (e.g. 300/10 is 30: the last zero is removed).
* Similarly, dividing a binary number through 2, which is what is done here,
  is the same as removing the last bit.
* This can be done by bitshifting it to the right with >>1.
* But, here we're bitshifting a 24-bit integer (actually 32-bit, but the first
  8 bits aren't used).
* Because of this, the last bit of one byte will become the first bit of the
  next byte, and that screws up the color values!
* So after the bitshift, the first bit of every byte has to be set to zero,
  and that can be done by binary "AND-ing" the value with the binary value
  011111110111111101111111, which is 8355711 in decimal.
* So the result of this is indeed a darker color.

'''

* Finally, the current buffer pixel is set to this color, and we move on to the next y.

      {
        // Cast the texture coordinate to integer, and mask with (texHeight - 1) in case of overflow

        buffer[y][x] = color;
      }

* Now the buffer still has to be drawn, and after that it has to be cleared
  (where in the untextured version we simply had to use "cls". +
  Ensure to do it in scanline order for speed thanks to memory locality for
  caching).
* The rest of this code is again the same.

----

* And here's again the keys, nothing has changed here either.
* If you like you can try to add strafe keys (to strafe to the left and right).
* These have to be made the same way as the up and down keys, but use planeX
  and planeY instead of dirX and dirY.

[NOTE]
====
* Usually images are stored by horizontal scanlines, but for a raycaster the
  textures are drawn as vertical stripes.
* Therefore, to optimally use the cache of the CPU and avoid page misses, it
  might be more efficient to store the textures in memory vertical stripe by
  vertical stripe, instead of per horizontal scanline.
* To do this, after generating the textures, swap their X and Y by (this code
  only works if texWidth and texHeight are the same):
====

[,c++]
----
  //swap texture X/Y since they'll be used as vertical stripes
  for(size_t i = 0; i < 8; i++)
  for(size_t x = 0; x < texSize; x++)
  for(size_t y = 0; y < x; y++)
  std::swap(texture[i][texSize * y + x], texture[i][texSize * x + y]);
----

* Or just swap X and Y where the textures are generated, but in many cases
  after loading an image or getting a texture from other formats you'll have
  it in scanlines anyway and have to swap it this way.

'''

* When getting the pixel from the texture then, use the following code
  instead:

[,c++]
----
Uint32 color = texture[texNum][texSize * texX + texY];

== Wolfenstein 3D Textures

* Instead of just generating some textures, let's load a few from images
  instead!
* For example the following 8 textures, which come from Wolfenstein 3D and are
  copyright by ID Software.

image::wolftextures.png[]

'''

* Just replace the part of the code that generates the texture patterns with
  the following (and make sure those textures are in the correct path).
* You can download the textures here.

[,c++]
----
  //generate some textures
  unsigned long tw, th;
  loadImage(texture[0], tw, th, "pics/eagle.png");
  loadImage(texture[1], tw, th, "pics/redbrick.png");
  loadImage(texture[2], tw, th, "pics/purplestone.png");
  loadImage(texture[3], tw, th, "pics/greystone.png");
  loadImage(texture[4], tw, th, "pics/bluestone.png");
  loadImage(texture[5], tw, th, "pics/mossy.png");
  loadImage(texture[6], tw, th, "pics/wood.png");
  loadImage(texture[7], tw, th, "pics/colorstone.png");
----

* In the original Wolfenstein 3D, the colors of one side was also made darker
  than the color of the other side of a wall to create the shadow effect, but
  they used a seperate texture every time, a dark and a light one.
* Here however, only one texture is used for each wall and the line of code
  that divided R, G and B through 2 is what makes the y-sides darker.

== Performance Considerations

* On a modern computer, when using high resolution (4K, as of 2019), this
  software raycaster will be slower than some much more complex 3D graphics
  get rendered on the GPU with a 3D graphics card.

'''

* There are at least two issues holding back speed of the raycaster code in
  this tutorial, which you can take into account if you'd like to make a super
  fast raycaster for very high resolutions:

'''

* Raycasting works with vertical stripes, but the screen buffer in memory is
  laid out with horizontal scanlines. +
  So drawing vertical stripes is bad for memory locality for caching (it is in
  fact a worst case scenario), and the loss of good caching may hurt the speed
  more than some of the 3D computations on modern machines. +
  It may be possible to program this with better caching behavior (e.g.
  processing multiple stripes at once, using a cache-oblivious transpose
  algorithm, or having a 90 degree rotated raycaster), but for simplicity the
  rest of this tutorial ignores this caching issue.
* This is using software blitting with SDL (in QuickCG, in redraw()), which is
  slow for large resolutions compared to hardware rendering. +
  Likely QuickCG's usage of SDL itself is not optimal and e.g. using OpenGL
  (even for software rendering) may be faster, so that may be fixable behind
  the scenes. +
  Since this CG tutorial is about software rendering this issue is ignored
  here as well.
