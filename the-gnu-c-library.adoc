= The GNU C Library

* This is _The GNU C Library Reference Manual_, for version 2.38.

== 12 Input/Output on Streams

* This chapter describes the functions for creating streams and performing
  input and output operations on them.
* As discussed in Input/Output Overview, a stream is a fairly abstract,
  high-level concept representing a communications channel to a file, device,
  or process.

=== 12.12 Formatted Output

* The functions described in this section (printf and related functions)
  provide a convenient way to perform formatted output.
* You call `printf` with a _format string_ or _template string_ that specifies
  how to format the values of the remaining arguments.

'''

* Unless your program is a filter that specifically performs line- or
  character-oriented processing, using `printf` or one of the other related
  functions described in this section is usually the easiest and most concise
  way to perform output.
* These functions are especially useful for printing error messages, tables of
  data, and the like.

==== 12.12.6 Other Output Conversions

* This section describes miscellaneous conversions for `printf`.

'''

* If you accidentally pass a null pointer as the argument for a \'``%s``'
  conversion, the GNU C Library prints it as \'``(null)``'.
* We think this is more useful than crashing.
* But it's not good practice to pass a null argument intentionally.


* In the GNU C Library, non-null pointers are printed as unsigned integers, as
  if a \'``%#x``' conversion were used.
* Null pointers print as \'``(nil)``'.

'''

* You can supply the \'``-``' flag with the \'``%p``' conversion to specify
  left-justification, but no other flags, precision, or type modifiers are
  defined.

* The \'``%%``' conversion prints a literal \'``%``' character.
* This conversion doesn't use an argument, and no flags, field width,
  precision, or type modifiers are permitted.
