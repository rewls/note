= AppArmor Quick introduction

* apparmor.net

* AppArmor is an effective and easy-to-use Linux application security system.
* AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and applications from
  external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good
  behavior and preventing both known and unknown application flaws from being
  exploited.

'''

* AppArmor supplements the traditional Unix discretionary access control (DAC)
  model by providing mandatory access control (MAC).
* It has been included in the mainline Linux kernel since version 2.6.36 and
  its development has been supported by Canonical since 2009.

== Installation

* Many Linux distributions (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE) ship with AppArmor.

'''

* Simply run `aa-status` to see if your Linux distribution already has
  AppArmor integrated:
+
[source,sh]
$ aa-status
apparmor module is loaded.
