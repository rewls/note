VIM Tutor Version 1.7
____

* Vim is a very powerful editor that has many commands, too many to explain in a
  tutor such as this.
* This tutor is designed to describe enough of the commands that you will be
  able to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor.

'''

* The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 30 minutes, depending
  upon how much time is spent with experimentation.

== Lesson 1.1: Moving the cursor

[.lead]
To move the cursor, press the kbd:[h], kbd:[j], kbd:[k], kbd:[l] keys as indicated.

....
	     ^
	     k
       < h	 l >
	     j
	     v
....

. Hold down the down key (kbd:[j]) until it repeats.

[NOTE]
====
* If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press kbd:[<ESC>] to place
  you in Normal mode.
* Then retype the command you wanted.
====

== Lesson 1.2: Exiting vim

. Press the kbd:[<ESC>] key (to make sure you are in Normal mode).

. Type: ``:q!``kbd:[<ENTER>].
* This exits the editor, DISCARDING any changes you have made.
. Get back here by executing the command that got you into this tutor.

== Lesson 1.3: Text editing - deletion

[.lead]
Press kbd:[x] to delete the character under the cursor.

. To fix the errors, move the cursor until it is on top of the character to be
  deleted.
. Press the kbd:[x] key to delete the unwanted character.

== Lesson 1.4: Text editing - insertion

[.lead]
Press kbd:[i] to insert text.

. Move the cursor on top of the character BEFORE which the text is to be
  inserted.
. Press kbd:[i] and type in the necessary additions.
. As each error is fixed press kbd:[<ESC>] to return to Normal mode.

== Lesson 1.5: Text editing - appending

[.lead]
Press kbd:[A] to append text.

. Press kbd:[A] and type in the necessary additions.
. As the text has been appended press kbd:[<ESC>] to return to Normal mode.

== Lesson 1.6: Editing a file

[.lead]
Use `:wq` to save a file and exit.

. At the shell prompt type this command: ``vim file.txt``kbd:[<ENTER>]
* `vim` is the command to start the Vim editor, `file.txt` is the name of the
  file you wish to edit.
* Use the name of a file that you can change.
. Insert and delete text as you learned in the previous lessons.
. Save the file with changes and exit Vim with: ``wq``kbd:[<ENTER>]

== Lesson 1 Summary

. The cursor is moved using either the arrow keys or the
  kbd:[h]kbd:[j]kbd:[k]kbd:[l] keys.
+
```
	 h (left)	j (down)       k (up)	    l (right)
```
. To start Vim from the shell prompt type:  ``vim _FILENAME_``kbd:[<ENTER>]
. To exit Vim type: kbd:[<ESC>]``:q!``kbd:[<ENTER>] to trash all changes.
* OR type: kbd:[<ESC>]``:wq``kbd:[<ENTER>] to save the changes.
. To delete the character at the cursor type: kbd:[x]
. To insert or append text type:
* kbd:[i] type inserted text kbd:[<ESC>]: insert before the cursor
* kbd:[A] type appended text kbd:[<ESC>]: append after the line

[NOTE]
====
* Pressing kbd:[<ESC>] will place you in Normal mode or will cancel an unwanted
  and partially completed command.
====

== Lesson 2.1: Deletion commands

[.lead]
Type kbd:[dw]  to delete a word.

. Press kbd:[<ESC>] to make sure you are in Normal mode.
. Move the cursor to the beginning of a word that needs to be deleted.
. Type kbd:[dw] to make the word disappear.

[NOTE]
====
* The letter kbd:[d] will appear on the last line of the screen as you type it.
* Vim is waiting for you to type kbd:[w].
* If you see another character than kbd:[d] you typed something wrong; press
  kbd:[<ESC>] and start over.
====

== Lesson 2.2: More deletion commands

[.lead]
Type kbd:[d$] to delete to the end of the line.

. Press kbd:[<ESC>] to make sure you are in Normal mode.
. Type kbd:[d$] to delete to the end of the line.

== Lesson 2.3: On operators and motions

* Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
* The format for a delete command with the kbd:[d] delete operator is as
  follows:
+
....
  	d   motion
....
* Where:
** `d` is the delete operator.
** `motion` is what the operator will operate on (listed below).

* A short list of motions:
** kbd:[w] - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
** kbd:[e] - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
** kbd:[$] - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.

* Thus typing kbd:[de] will delete from the cursor to the end of the word.

[NOTE]
====
* Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator will move
  the cursor as specified.
====

== Lesson 2.4: Using a count for a motion

[.lead]
Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times.

. Type kbd:[2w] to move the cursor two words forward.
. Type kbd:[3e] to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward.
. Type kbd:[0] (zero) to move to the start of the line.

== Lesson 2.5: Using a count to delete more

[.lead]
Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times.

* In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
  insert a count before the motion to delete more:
+
....
	 d   number   motion
....

[]
. Type kbd:[d2w] to delete two words.
. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete consecutive words with
  one command.

== Lesson 2.6: Operating on lines

[.lead]
Type kbd:[dd] to delete a whole line.

* Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided it
  would be easier to simply type two kbd:[d]'s to delete a line.

[]
. Type kbd:[dd] to delete the line.
. Type kbd:[2dd] to delete two lines.

[]
* Doubling to operate on a line also works for operators mentioned below.

== Lesson 2.7: The undo command

[.lead]
Press kbd:[u] to undo the last commands, kbd:[U] to fix a whole line.

. Place it on the first error.
. Type kbd:[x] to delete the first unwanted character.
. Now type kbd:[u] to undo the last command executed.
. This time fix all the errors on the line using the kbd:[x] command.
. Now type a capital kbd:[U] to return the line to its original state.
. Now type kbd:[u] a few times to undo the kbd:[U] and preceding commands.
. Now type kbd:[CTRL-R] (keeping kbd:[CTRL] key pressed while hitting kbd:[R]) a
  few times to redo the commands (undo the undos).

== Lesson 2 Summary

. To delete from the cursor up to the next word type: kbd:[dw]
. To delete from the cursor up to the end of the word type: kbd:[de]
. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type: kbd:[d$]
. To delete a whole line type: kbd:[dd]

. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number: kbd:[2w]
. The format for a change command is:
+
....
               operator   [number]   motion
....
* where:
** `operator` is what to do, such as kbd:[d] for delete
** `[number]` is an optional count to repeat the motion
** `motion` moves over the text to operate on, such as kbd:[w] (word), kbd:[e]
   (end of word), kbd:[$] (end of the line), etc.

. To move to the start of the line use a zero: kbd:[0]
. To undo previous actions, type: kbd:[u] (lowercase u)
* To undo all the changes on a line, type: kbd:[U] (capital U)
* To undo the undos, type: kbd:[CTRL-R]

== Lesson 3.1: The put command

[.lead]
Type kbd:[p] to put previously deleted text after the cursor.

. Type kbd:[dd] to delete the line and store it in a Vim register.
. Move the cursor to a line, ABOVE where the deleted line should go.
. Type kbd:[p] to put the line below the cursor.

== Lesson 3.2: The replace command

[.lead]
Type kbd:[rx] to replace the character at the cursor with x.

. Move the cursor so that it is on top of the first error.
. Type kbd:[r] and then the character which should be there.

== Lesson 3.3: The change operator

[.lead]
To change until the end of a word, type kbd:[ce]. 

. Type kbd:[ce] and the correct word.

[]
* Notice that kbd:[ce] deletes the word and places you in Insert mode.
* kbd:[cc] does the same for the whole line.

== Lesson 3.4: More changes using kbd:[c]

[.lead]
The change operator is used with the same motions as delete.

. The change operator works in the same way as delete.
* The format is:
+
....
         c    [number]   motion
....
. The motions are the same, such as kbd:[w] (word) and kbd:[$] (end of line).
. Move the cursor to the first error.
. Type kbd:[c$] and type the rest of the line and press kbd:[<ESC>].

[NOTE]
====
* You can use the kbd:[Backspace] key to correct mistakes while typing.
====

== Lesson 3 Summary

. To put back text that has just been deleted, type kbd:[p].
* This puts the deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go
  on the line below the cursor).
. To replace the character under the cursor, type kbd:[r] and then the character
  you want to have there.
. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the motion
  takes you.
* eg. Type kbd:[ce] to change from the cursor to the end of the word, kbd:[c$]
  to change to the end of a line.
. The format for change is:
+
....
	 c   [number]   motion
....

== Lesson 4.1: Cursor location and file status

[.lead]
Type kbd:[CTRL-G] to show your location in the file and the file status.
Type kbd:[G] to move to a line in the file.

. Hold down the kbd:[Ctrl] key and press kbd:[g].
* We call this kbd:[CTRL-G].
* A message will appear at the bottom of the page with the filename and the
  position in the file.
* Remember the line number for Step 3.
+
[NOTE]
====
* You may see the cursor position in the lower right corner of the screen.
* This happens when the 'ruler' option is set (see  `:help 'ruler'`)
====
. Press kbd:[G] to move you to the bottom of the file.
* Type kbd:[gg] to move you to the start of the file.
. Type the number of the line you were on and then kbd:[G].
* This will return you to the line you were on when you first pressed
  kbd:[CTRL-G].

== Lesson 4.2: The search command

[.lead]
Type kbd:[/] followed by a phrase to search for the phrase.

. In Normal mode type the kbd:[/] character.
* Notice that it and the cursor appear at the bottom of the screen as with the
  kbd:[:] command.
. Now type 'errroor'kbd:[<ENTER>].
* This is the word you want to search for.
. To search for the same phrase again, simply type kbd:[n].
* To search for the same phrase in the opposite direction, type kbd:[N].
. To search for a phrase in the backward direction, use kbd:[?] instead of
  kbd:[/] .
. To go back to where you came from press kbd:[CTRL-O] (Keep kbd:[Ctrl] down
  while pressing the letter kbd:[o]).
* Repeat to go back further.
* kbd:[CTRL-I] goes forward.

[NOTE]
====
* When the search reaches the end of the file it will continue at the start,
  unless the 'wrapscan' option has been reset.
====

== Lesson 4.3: Matching parentheses search

[.lead]
Type kbd:[%] to find a matching ), ], or }.

. Place the cursor on any (, [, or {.
. Now type the kbd:[%] character.
. The cursor will move to the matching parenthesis or bracket.
. Type kbd:[%] to move the cursor to the other matching bracket.
. Move the cursor to another (, ), [, ], { or } and see what kbd:[%] does.

[NOTE]
====
* This is very useful in debugging a program with unmatched parentheses!
====

== Lesson 4.4: The substitute command

[.lead]
Type `:s/old/new/g` to substitute 'new' for 'old'.

. Type ``:s/thee/the``kbd:[<ENTER>].
* Note that this command only changes the first occurrence of "thee" in the
  line.
. Now type `:s/thee/the/g`.
* Adding the `g` flag means to substitute globally in the line, change all
  occurrences of "thee" in the line.
. To change every occurrence of a character string between two lines,
* type `:\#,#s/old/new/g` where `#,#` are the line numbers of the range of lines
  where the substitution is to be done.
* Type `:%s/old/new/g` to change every occurrence in the whole file.
* Type `:%s/old/new/gc` to find every occurrence in the whole file, with a
  prompt whether to substitute or not.

== Lesson 4 Summary

. kbd:[CTRL-G] displays your location in the file and the file status.
* kbd:[G] moves to the end of the file.
* kbd:[__number__G] moves to that line number.
* kbd:[gg] moves to the first line.
. Typing kbd:[/] followed by a phrase searches FORWARD for the phrase.
* Typing kbd:[?] followed by a phrase searches BACKWARD for the phrase.
* After a search type kbd:[n] to find the next occurrence in the same direction
  or kbd:[N] to search in the opposite direction.
* kbd:[CTRL-O] takes you back to older positions, kbd:[CTRL-I] to newer
  positions.
. Typing kbd:[%] while the cursor is on a (, ), [, ], {, or } goes to its match.
. To substitute new for the first old in a line type `:s/old/new`
* To substitute new for all 'old's on a line type `:s/old/new/g`
* To substitute phrases between two line \#'s type `:#,#s/old/new/g`
* To substitute all occurrences in the file type `:%s/old/new/g`
* To ask for confirmation each time add 'c' `:%s/old/new/gc`

== Lesson 5.1: How to execute an external command

[.lead]
Type `:!` followed by an external command to execute that command.

. Type the familiar command kbd:[:] to set the cursor at the bottom of the
  screen.
* This allows you to enter a command-line command.
. Now type the kbd:[!] (exclamation point) character.
* This allows you to execute any external shell command.
. As an example type `ls` following the `!` and then hit kbd:[<ENTER>].
* This will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the
  shell prompt.

[NOTE]
====
* It is possible to execute any external command this way, also with arguments.
====

[NOTE]
====
* All kbd:[:] commands must be finished by hitting kbd:[<ENTER>]
* From here on we will not always mention it.
====

== Lesson 5.2: More on writing files

[.lead]
To save the changes made to the text, type `:w _FILENAME_`

. Type `:!ls` to get a listing of your directory.
. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as `TEST`.
. Now type: `:w TEST` (where `TEST` is the filename you chose.)
. This saves the whole file (the Vim Tutor) under the name `TEST`.
. To verify this, type or `:!ls` again to see your directory.
. Now remove the file by typing (Unix):	`:!rm TEST`

== Lesson 5.3: Selecting text to write

[.lead]
To save part of the file, type kbd:[v] motion `:w _FILENAME_`

. Move the cursor to this line.
. Press kbd:[v] and move the cursor to the fifth item below.
* Notice that the text is highlighted.
. Press the kbd:[:] character.
* At the bottom of the screen `:'<,'>` will appear.
. Type `w TEST`, where `TEST` is a filename that does not exist yet.
* Verify that you see `:'<,'>w TEST` before you press kbd:[<ENTER>].
. Vim will write the selected lines to the file TEST.
* Use `:!ls` to see it.
* Do not remove it yet!
* We will use it in the next lesson.

[NOTE]
====
* Pressing kbd:[v] starts Visual selection.
* You can move the cursor around to make the selection bigger or smaller.
* Then you can use an operator to do something with the text.
* For example, kbd:[d] deletes the text.
====

== Lesson 5.4: Retrieving and merging files

[.lead]
To insert the contents of a file, type `:r _FILENAME_`

. Place the cursor just above this line.
+
[NOTE]
====
* After executing Step 2 you will see text from lesson 5.3.
* Then move DOWN to see this lesson again.
====
. Now retrieve your `TEST` file using the command `:r TEST` where `TEST` is the
  name of the file you used.
* The file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.
. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there are now
  two copies of lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.

[NOTE]
====
* You can also read the output of an external command.
* For example, `:r !ls`  reads the output of the ls command and puts it below
  the cursor.
====

== Lesson 5 Summary

. `:!command`  executes an external command.
* Some useful examples are:
** (Unix)
** `:!ls` shows a directory listing.
** `:!rm _FILENAME_` removes file `_FILENAME_`.
. `:w _FILENAME_` writes the current Vim file to disk with name `_FILENAME_`.
. kbd:[v] motion `:w _FILENAME_` saves the Visually selected lines in file
  `_FILENAME_`.
. `:r _FILENAME_` retrieves disk file `_FILENAME_` and puts it below the cursor
  position.
. `:r !dir` reads the output of the `dir` command and puts it below the cursor
  position.

== Lesson 6.1: The open command

[.lead]
Type kbd:[o] to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode.

. Type the lowercase letter kbd:[o] to open up a line BELOW the cursor and place
  you in Insert mode.
. Now type some text and press kbd:[<ESC>] to exit Insert mode.
. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital kbd:[O], rather than
  a lowercase kbd:[o].

== Lesson 6.2: The append command

[.lead]
Type kbd:[a] to insert text AFTER the cursor.

. Type an kbd:[a] (lowercase) to append text AFTER the cursor.
. Complete the word.
* Press kbd:[<ESC>] to exit Insert mode.

[NOTE]
====
* kbd:[a], kbd:[i] and kbd:[A] all go to the same Insert mode, the only
  difference is where the characters are inserted.
====

== Lesson 6.3: Another way to replace

[.lead]
Type a capital kbd:[R] to replace more than one character.

. Now press kbd:[R].
. Press kbd:[<ESC>] to leave Replace mode.
* Notice that the rest of the line remains unmodified.

[NOTE]
====
* Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an
  existing character.
====

== Lesson 6.4: Copy and paste text

[.lead]
Use the kbd:[y] operator to copy text and kbd:[p] to paste it

. Start Visual mode with kbd:[v] and move the cursor
. Type kbd:[y] to yank (copy) the highlighted text.
. Type kbd:[p] to put (paste) the text.

[NOTE]
====
* You can also use kbd:[y]  as an operator: kbd:[yw] yanks one word, kbd:[yy]
  yanks the whole line, then  kbd:[p] puts that line.
====

== Lesson 6.5: Set option

[.lead]
Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case

. Search for 'ignore' by entering: `/ignore` kbd:[<ENTER>]
* Repeat several times by pressing  kbd:[n].
. Set the 'ic' (Ignore case) option by entering: `:set ic`
. Now search for 'ignore' again by pressing kbd:[n].
* Notice that Ignore and IGNORE are now also found.
. Set the 'hlsearch' and 'incsearch' options: `:set hls is`
. Now type the search command again and see what happens: `/ignore`
  kbd:[<ENTER>]
. To disable ignoring case enter: `:set noic`

[NOTE]
====
* To remove the highlighting of matches enter: `:nohlsearch`
====

[NOTE]
====
* If you want to ignore case for just one search command, use `\c` in the
  phrase: `/ignore\c` kbd:[<ENTER>]
====

== Lesson 6 Summary

. Type kbd:[o] to open a line BELOW the cursor and start Insert mode.
* Type kbd:[O] to open a line ABOVE the cursor.
. Type kbd:[a] to insert text AFTER the cursor.
* Type kbd:[A] to insert text after the end of the line.
. The kbd:[e] command moves to the end of a word.
. The kbd:[y] operator yanks (copies) text, kbd:[p] puts (pastes) it.
. Typing a capital kbd:[R] enters Replace mode until kbd:[<ESC>] is pressed.
. Typing ":set xxx" sets the option "xxx".
* Some options are:
** 'ic' 'ignorecase' ignore upper/lower case when searching
** 'is' 'incsearch' show partial matches for a search phrase
** 'hls' 'hlsearch' highlight all matching phrases
* You can either use the long or the short option name.
. Prepend "no" to switch an option off: `:set noic`

== Lesson 7.1: Getting help

[.lead]
Use the on-line help system

* Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.
* To get started, try one of these three:
** press the kbd:[<HELP>] key (if you have one)
** press the kbd:[<F1>] key (if you have one)
** type `:help` kbd:[<ENTER>]

'''

* Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
* Type kbd:[CTRL-W CTRL-W]  to jump from one window to another.
* Type `:q` kbd:[<ENTER>] to close the help window.

'''

* You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the
  ":help" command.
* Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):
+
[source,vim]
:help w
:help c_CTRL-D
:help insert-index
:help user-manual

== Lesson 7.2: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT

[.lead]
Enable Vim features

* Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by default.
* To start using more features you should create a "vimrc" file.

'''

. Start editing the "vimrc" file.
* This depends on your system:
** `:e ~/.vimrc` for Unix
. Now read the example "vimrc" file contents:
+
[source,vim]
:r $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim

. Write the file with:
+
[source,vim]
:w
 
* The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting.
* You can add all your preferred settings to this "vimrc" file.
* For more information type `:help vimrc-intro`

== Lesson 7.3: Completion

[.lead]
Command line completion with kbd:[CTRL-D] and kbd:[<TAB>]

. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode: `:set nocp`
. Look what files exist in the directory: `:!ls`
. Type the start of a command: `:e`
. Press kbd:[CTRL-D] and Vim will show a list of commands that start with "e".
. Type kbd:[d<TAB>] and Vim will complete the command name to ":edit".
. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name: `:edit FIL`
. Press kbd:[<TAB>].
* Vim will complete the name (if it is unique).

[NOTE]
====
* Completion works for many commands.
* Just try pressing kbd:[CTRL-D] and kbd:[<TAB>].
* It is especially useful for `:help`.
====

== Lesson 7 Summary

. Type `:help` or press kbd[<F1>] or kbd:[<HELP>] to open a help window.
. Type `:help cmd` to find help on `cmd`.
. Type  kbd:[CTRL-W CTRL-W] to jump to another window.
. Type `:q` to close the help window.
. Create a `vimrc` startup script to keep your preferred settings.
. When typing a `:` command, press kbd:[CTRL-D] to see possible completions.
* Press kbd:[<TAB>] to use one completion.

'''

* This concludes the Vim Tutor.
* It was intended to give a brief overview of the Vim editor, just enough to
  allow you to use the editor fairly easily.
* It is far from complete as Vim has many many more commands.
* Read the user manual next: ":help user-manual".

'''

* For further reading and studying, this book is recommended:
** Vim - Vi Improved - by Steve Oualline
** Publisher: New Riders
* The first book completely dedicated to Vim.
* Especially useful for beginners.
