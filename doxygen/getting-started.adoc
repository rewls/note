* The executable `doxygen` is the main program that parses the sources and
  generates the documentation.
* See section Doxygen usage for more detailed usage information.

'''

* Optionally, the executable doxywizard can be used, which is a graphical
  front-end for editing the configuration file that is used by Doxygen and for
  running Doxygen in a graphical environment.

'''

* The following figure shows the relation between the tools and the flow of
  information between them (it looks complex but that's only because it tries to
  be complete):

:step0: Step 0: Check if Doxygen supports your programming/hardware \
	description language
== {step0}

* First, assure that your programming/hardware description language has a
  reasonable chance of being recognized by Doxygen.
* These programming languages are supported by default: C, C++, Java and Python.
* Doxygen also supports the hardware description language VHDL by default.

== Step 1: Creating a configuration file

* Doxygen uses a configuration file to determine all of its settings.
* Each project should get its own configuration file.
* A project can consist of a single source file, but can also be an entire
  source tree that is recursively scanned.

'''

* To simplify the creation of a configuration file, Doxygen can create a
  template configuration file for you.
* To do this call `doxygen` from the command line with the `-g` option:
+
[source,sh]
doxygen -g <config-file>

** where <config-file> is the name of the configuration file.
* If you omit the file name, a file named `Doxyfile` will be created.
* If a file with the name <config-file> already exists, Doxygen will rename it
  to <config-file>.bak before generating the configuration template.
* If you use - (i.e. the minus sign) as the file name then Doxygen will try to
  read the configuration file from standard input (stdin), which can be useful
  for scripting.

'''

* The configuration file has a format that is similar to that of a (simple)
  Makefile.
* It consists of a number of assignments (tags) of the form:
+
....
TAGNAME = VALUE or
TAGNAME = VALUE1 VALUE2 ...
....

* You can probably leave the values of most tags in a generated template
  configuration file to their default value.
* See section Configuration for more details about the configuration file.

'''

* If you do not wish to edit the configuration file with a text editor, you
  should have a look at Doxywizard, which is a GUI front-end that can create,
  read and write Doxygen configuration files, and allows setting configuration
  options by entering them via dialogs.

'''

* For a small project consisting of a few C and/or C++ source and header files,
  you can leave INPUT tag empty and Doxygen will search for sources in the
  current directory.

'''

* If you have a larger project consisting of a source directory or tree you
  should assign the root directory or directories to the INPUT tag, and add one
  or more file patterns to the FILE_PATTERNS tag (for instance *.cpp *.h).
* Only files that match one of the patterns will be parsed (if the patterns are
  omitted a list of typical patterns is used for the types of files Doxygen
  supports).
* For recursive parsing of a source tree you must set the RECURSIVE tag to YES.
* To further fine-tune the list of files that is parsed the EXCLUDE and
  EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tags can be used.
* To omit all test directories from a source tree for instance, one could use:
+
....
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = */test/*
....

* Doxygen looks at the file's extension to determine how to parse a file, using
  the following table:
+
[%autowidth]
|===
|Extension	|Language

|.py		|Python
|.c		|C / C++
|.cc		|C / C++
|.txt		|C / C++
|.java		|Java
|.md		|Markdown
|.h		|C / C++
|===

* Please note that the above list might contain more items than that by default
  set in the FILE_PATTERNS.

'''

* Any extension that is not parsed can be set by adding it to FILE_PATTERNS and
  when the appropriate EXTENSION_MAPPING is set.

'''

* If you start using Doxygen for an existing project (thus without any
  documentation that Doxygen is aware of), you can still get an idea of what the
  structure is and how the documented result would look like.
* To do so, you must set the EXTRACT_ALL tag in the configuration file to YES.
* Then, Doxygen will pretend everything in your sources is documented.
* Please note that as a consequence warnings about undocumented members will not
  be generated as long as EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES.

'''

* To analyze an existing piece of software it is useful to cross-reference a
  (documented) entity with its definition in the source files.
* Doxygen will generate such cross-references if you set the SOURCE_BROWSER tag
  to YES.
* It can also include the sources directly into the documentation by setting
  INLINE_SOURCES to YES (this can be handy for code reviews for instance).

== Step 2: Running Doxygen

* To generate the documentation you can now enter:
+
[source,sh]
doxygen <config-file>

* Depending on your settings Doxygen will create `html`, `rtf`, `latex`, `xml`,
  `man`, and/or docbook directories inside the output directory.
* As the names suggest these directories contain the generated documentation in
  HTML, RTF, LaTeX, XML, Unix-Man page, and DocBook format.

'''

* The default output directory is the directory in which doxygen is started.
* The root directory to which the output is written can be changed using the
  OUTPUT_DIRECTORY.
* The format specific directory within the output directory can be selected
  using the HTML_OUTPUT, RTF_OUTPUT, LATEX_OUTPUT, XML_OUTPUT, MAN_OUTPUT, and
  DOCBOOK_OUTPUT tags of the configuration file.
* If the output directory does not exist, doxygen will try to create it for you
  (but it will not try to create a whole path recursively, like `mkdir -p`
  does).

=== HTML output

* The generated HTML documentation can be viewed by pointing a HTML browser to
  the `index.html` file in the `html` directory.
* For the best results a browser that supports cascading style sheets (CSS)
  should be used.
 
'''

* Some of the features the HTML section (such as GENERATE_TREEVIEW or the search
  engine) require a browser that supports Dynamic HTML and JavaScript enabled.

== Step 3: Documenting the sources

* Although documenting the sources is presented as step 3, in a new project this
  should of course be step 1.
* Here I assume you already have some code and you want Doxygen to generate a
  nice document describing the API and maybe the internals and some related
  design documentation as well.

'''

* If the EXTRACT_ALL option is set to NO in the configuration file (the
  default), then Doxygen will only generate documentation for documented
  entities.
* So how do you document these?
* For members, classes and namespaces there are basically two options:
. Place a special documentation block in front of the declaration or definition
  of the member, class or namespace.
** For file, class and namespace members it is also allowed to place the
  documentation directly after the member.
+
'''
** See section Special comment blocks to learn more about special documentation
  blocks.

. Place a special documentation block somewhere else (another file or another
  location) and put a structural command in the documentation block.
** A structural command links a documentation block to a certain entity that can
  be documented (e.g. a member, class, namespace or file).
+
'''
** See section Documentation at other places to learn more about structural
  commands.

'''

* The advantage of the first option is that you do not have to repeat the name
  of the entity.

'''

* Files can only be documented using the second option, since there is no way to
  put a documentation block before a file.
* Of course, file members (functions, variables, typedefs, defines) do not need
  an explicit structural command; just putting a special documentation block in
  front or behind them will work fine.

'''

* The text inside a special documentation block is parsed before it is written
  to the HTML and/or LaTeX output files.

'''

* During parsing the following steps take place:
** Markdown formatting is replaced by corresponding HTML or special commands.
** The special commands inside the documentation are executed.
*** See section Special Commands for an overview of all commands.
** If a line starts with some whitespace followed by one or more asterisks (*)
   and then optionally more whitespace, then all whitespace and asterisks are
   removed.
** All resulting blank lines are treated as a paragraph separators.
*** This saves you from placing new-paragraph commands yourself in order to make
    the generated documentation readable.
** Links are created for words corresponding to documented classes (unless the
   word is preceded by a %; then the word will not be linked and the % sign is
   removed).
** Links to members are created when certain patterns are found in the text.
*** See section Automatic link generation for more information on how the
   automatic link generation works.
** HTML tags that are in the documentation are interpreted and converted to
   LaTeX equivalents for the LaTeX output.
*** See section HTML Commands for an overview of all supported HTML tags.
