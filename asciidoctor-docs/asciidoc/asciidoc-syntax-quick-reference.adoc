====
* The examples on this page demonstrate the output produced by the built-in HTML converter.
* An AsciiDoc converter is expected to produce complementary output when generating other output formats, such as PDF, EPUB, and DocBook.

== Paragraphs

.Example 1. Paragraph
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
Paragraphs don't require special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is defined by one or more consecutive lines of text.
Line breaks within a paragraph are not displayed.

Leave at least one empty line to begin a new paragraph.

.Example 2. Literal paragraph
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
A normal paragraph.

 A literal paragraph.
 One or more consecutive lines indented by at least one space.

 The text is shown in a fixed-width (typically monospace) font.
 The lines are preformatted (i.e., as formatted in the source).
 Spaces and newlines,
 like the ones in this sentence,
 are preserved.

[TIP]
====
* The default Asciidoctor stylesheet automatically styles the first paragraph of the preamble as a lead paragraph if no role is specified on that paragraph.
====

== Text formatting

.Example 5. Constrained bold, italic, and monospace
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
It has *strong* significance to me.

I _cannot_ stress this enough.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The ``link:`` macro prefix is not required when the target starts with a URL scheme like ``https:``.
* The URL scheme acts as an implicit macro prefix.
====

[CAUTION]
====
* If the link text contains a comma and the text is followed by one or more named attributes, you must enclose the text in double quotes.
* Otherwise, the text will be cut off at the comma (and the remaining text will get pulled into the attribute parsing).

== Document header

* The document header is optional.
* The header may not contain any empty lines and must be separated from the content by at least one empty line.

.Example 18. Title
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title

This document provides...
----
--

== Section titles

* When the document type is `article` (the default), the document can only have one level 0 section title (``=``), which is the document title (i.e., doctitle).

.Example 22. Article section levels
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title
----
--

* The `book` document type can have additional level 0 section titles, which are interpreted as parts.
* The presence of at least one part implicitly makes the document a multi-part book.

.Example 23. Book section levels
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

= Level 0 Section Title (Part)

====== Level 5 Section Title

= Another Level 0 Section Title (Part)
----

.Example 24. Discrete heading (not a section)
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
[discrete]
=== I'm an independent heading!

This paragraph is its sibling, not its child.
----

====

== Automatic TOC

.Example 25. Activate Table of Contents for a document
--

--

.Example 28. Include content from a URL
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/main/README.adoc[]
----
--

[WARNING]
====
* Including content from a URL is potentially dangerous, so it's disabled if the safe mode is SECURE or greater.
* Assuming the safe mode is less than SECURE, you must also set the `allow-uri-read` attribute to permit the AsciiDoc processor to read content from a URL.
====

== Lists

.Example 29. Unordered list
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
* List item
** Nested list item
*** Deeper nested list item
* List item
 ** Another nested list item
* List item
----

====
* List item
** Nested list item
*** Deeper nested list item
* List item
 ** Another nested list item
* List item
====
--

[TIP]
====
* An empty line is required before and after a list to separate it from other blocks.
* You can force two adjacent lists apart by adding an empty attribute list (i.e., []) above the second list or by inserting an empty line followed by a line comment after the first list.
* If you use a line comment, the convention is to use //- to provide a hint to other authors that it's serving as a list divider.
====

.Example 30. Unordered list max level nesting
--
[source,asciidoc]

* Level 1 list item
** Level 2 list item

====
* Level 1 list item
** Level 2 list item
*** Level 3 list item

* The unordered list marker can be changed using a list style (e.g., square).

.Example 37. Complex content in outline lists
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content,
  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.
+
Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting
a list continuation on a line adjacent to both blocks.
+
list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ cd projects/my-book

* AsciiDoc lists may contain any complex content.

== Images

* You can use the imagesdir attribute to avoid hard coding the common path to your images in every image macro.
* The value of this attribute can be an absolute path, relative path, or base URL.
* If the image target is a relative path, the attribute's value is prepended (i.e., it's resolved relative to the value of the imagesdir attribute).
* If the image target is a URL or absolute path, the attribute's value is not prepended.

.Example 38. Block image macro

image::https://asciidoctor.org/images/octocat.jpg[GitHub mascot]
====
--

* Two colons following the image keyword in the macro (i.e., ``image::``) indicates a block image (aka figure), whereas one colon following the image keyword (i.e., `image:`) indicates an inline image.
** All macros follow this pattern.
* You use an inline image when you need to place the image in a line of text.
* Otherwise, you should prefer the block form.

== Keyboard, button, and menu macros

[NOTE]

* The indent attribute is frequently used when including source code by tagged region or lines.
* It can be specified on the include directive itself or the enclosing literal, listing, or source block.

[]
* When indent is 0, the leading block indent is stripped.

[]
* When indent is greater than 0, the leading block indent is first stripped, then a block is indented by the number of columns equal to this value.

== More delimited blocks

* Any block can have a title.
* A block title is defined using a line of text above the block that starts with a dot.
* That dot cannot be followed by a space.
* For block images, the title is displayed below the block.
* For all other blocks, the title is typically displayed above it.

== Tables

.Example 68. Table with a title, two columns, a header row, and two rows of content
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
.Table Title
|===
|Column 1, Header Row |Column 2, Header Row // <1>
// <2>
|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===
----
<1> Unless the `cols` attribute is specified, the number of columns is equal to the number of cell separators on the first (non-empty) line.
<2> When an empty line immediately follows a non-empty line at the start of the table, the cells in the first line get promoted to the table header.

====
.Table Title
|===
|Column 1, Header Row |Column 2, Header Row

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===
====
--

.Example 69. Table with two columns, a header row, and two rows of content
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
[%header,cols=2*] // <1>
|===
|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===
----
<1> The `*` in the `cols` attribute is the repeat operator.
+
It means repeat the column specification across the remaining columns.
+
In this case, we are repeating the default formatting across 2 columns.
+
When the cells in the header are not defined on a single line, you must use the cols attribute to set the number of columns in the table and the `%header` option (or `options=header` attribute) to promote the first row to the table header.

====
[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
